# Database Connection and Interaction Project

The purpose of the repository is to learn how to manipulate and work with databases in an **Initial and Advanced** way using the JavaScript language in its entirety along with node.js

<img align="center" alt="java" width="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original.svg">

</div>

In this interaction I will create a server for JavaScript so that it can make requests for full form.

## A little about the Database

Well, I chose two databases to make this connection, which are the following banks:

<div align="center" style="display: inline_block">
<img align="center" alt="mysql" width="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/mysql/mysql-original.svg">
<img align="center" alt="PostgreSql" width="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/postgresql/postgresql-original.svg">
</div>
<br>

The choice to use it was because they are the most used when it comes to relational databases, which are widely used in the market.

It was also a good way to practice SQL language skills with these databases.
